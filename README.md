This is my website

It was brute force coded by someone who isn't a dev

I used a wordpress theme and waaaaaay too many comments

It could probably be streamlined

It could probably work better

But this took me a day and cost me nothing

Also, if you need your header to work on mobile, add

>.header-image-bg {
background-position: center center;
}

to style.css

have a great day %^
